# Backend-Coding-Challenge

## About The Coding Challenge

- Develop a REST microservice that list the languages used by the 100 trending public repos on GitHub.
- For every language, you need to calculate the attributes below ðŸ‘‡:
    - Number of repos using this language
    - The list of repos using the language

Trending repositories simply translates to fetching the most starred repos created in the last 30 days ( from now ).
