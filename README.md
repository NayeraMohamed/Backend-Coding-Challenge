# Backend-Coding-Challenge

## About The Coding Challenge

- Develop a REST microservice that list the languages used by the 100 trending public repos on GitHub.
- For every language, you need to calculate the attributes below ðŸ‘‡:
    - Number of repos using this language
    - The list of repos using the language

Trending repositories simply translates to fetching the most starred repos created in the last 30 days ( from now ).

## Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Express - Node.js web framework](https://expressjs.com/)
